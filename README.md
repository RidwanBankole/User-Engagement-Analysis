## Introduction

Information is vital, and having access to the right information at the right time makes a difference in organizations that excel. Thus, effective communication and a deep understanding of how people are engaged on a communication platform are essential for success in today's digital landscape. This project seeks to unearth data-driven insight into how people are engaged in a WhatsApp group - a sole platform on which organization x has weekly meetings on Wednesdays and Saturdays. As a data analyst tasked with this, I harnessed data-driven insights to unveil valuable insights such as top contributors based on word volumes and chat volumes, most prevalent words, chat patterns, etc. These insights were communicated using appealing visuals through a user-friendly Power BI dashboard, providing stakeholders with a holistic view of the group's dynamics.


## Goal of the Project

> The goal is to write a Python script that seamlessly handles and transforms chat history initially stored as a TXT file into a structured CSV file, saved, and then imported the CSV file into Power BI to create an interactive dashboard for decisions.

## Problem Statements

Organization X needs help to assess the performance and user engagement on its only communication channel - WhatsApp. It seeks to analyze the chat history to reveal hidden patterns and enhance communication strategies and employee engagement.

## Outcome

As a data analyst, I extracted the WhatsApp chat history. Then, using Python, I expertly wrote a script that handles and transforms chat history data, initially stored as a TXT file, into a structured CSV format. This CSV file was seamlessly integrated into Power BI for advanced analysis and creating an interactive dashboard, enabling managers to make data-driven decisions on user engagement quickly. 


## Skills and Tools Used
* PowerBI
* DAX
* Project Management: Trello Board
* Data Visualization
* Data Cleaning
* Data Manipulation and Exploration 

## Data Preprocessing

The project began with extracting the WhatsApp chat history in its original TXT format. Using Python, I wrote a Python script to organize chat logs, removed stop words, and cleaned the text by removing punctuation and numbers. I tokenized the text for word volume analysis and encrypted users with unique sender IDs for privacy concerns. The clean data is saved as a CSV file. Then, I imported the CSV file into Power BI for further manipulation in Power Query in Power BI. Later, I used DAX to create some measures before building a Power BI dashboard for quick decision-making.


## Dashboard

The dashboard shows different chats that pleasantly communicate with the decision-makers, as depicted below. It has various options to filter down the information for a granular view and a clearer insight into the group dynamics.
