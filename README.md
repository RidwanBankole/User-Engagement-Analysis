## Introduction

Effective communication and a deep understanding of group dynamics are essential for success in today's digital landscape. This project delves into a WhatsApp group chat, where I harnessed data-driven insights to unveil valuable insights such as top contributors, prevalent words, and activity patterns. These discoveries were masterfully visualized in a Power BI dashboard, providing stakeholders with a holistic view of the group's dynamics.


## Goal of the Project

> The goal is to write a Python script that seamlessly handles and transforms chat history initially stored as a TXT file into a structured tabular format, subsequently saved as a CSV, and then imported the CSV file into Power BI for creating an interactive dashboard for decision.

## Problem Statements

Organization X needs help in its communication strategy and employee engagement. Its only mode of communication is through WhatsApp group, and it wants to analyze how active and engaged people are in the group. There is a need to analyze the chat history to reveal hidden patterns and enhance communication strategies and employee engagement.

## Outcome

Using Python to expertly handle and transform chat history data, initially stored as a TXT file, into a structured tabular format, subsequently saved as a CSV. This CSV file was seamlessly integrated into Power BI for advanced analysis and creating an interactive dashboard, enabling users to delve into finely detailed insights with flexible filtering options.

## Skills and Tools Used
* PowerBI
* DAX
* Project Management: Trello Board
* Data Visualization
* Data Cleaning
* Data Exploartion 

## Data Preprocessing

I began by using Pandas to read a TXT file. Using Python, I wrote a validator function to organize chat logs, removed stop words, and cleaned the text by removing punctuation and numbers. I tokenized the text for word length analysis and anonymized users with unique sender IDs. Additional features like date and time were engineered. After saving the cleaned data in CSV, I used Power Query in Power BI to further prepare the data before creating a dashboard for quick decision-making.


## Dashboard

As depicted below, the dashboard offers two distinct views: the project description and the dashboard view. The project description provides insights into the problem statement, whereas the dashboard presents essential Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Users can utilize the "Apply Filter" button to enable granular data exploration.
